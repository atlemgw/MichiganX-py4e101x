# Loop with strings
# friends is a list with strings
# the variable, friend, loops through every string in the list

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends :
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
print('Done')

# This loop is excactly the same as above
# But I have replaced friend with x to show it's not about the variable name, you can call it whatever you want

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for x in friends :
    print('Happy New Year:', x)
print('Done')
