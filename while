# Two examples of while loops counting from 5 to 0 and then print out "blastoff"

# First loop show the importans of identation using the print function at last
# the loop prints 5,4,3,2,1, blastoff
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n-1
print("Blastoff")

# Second loop show how identation can go wrong if it's not placed in its right place
# The loop will say 5 blastoff, 4 blastoff, 3 blastoff etc.
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n-1
    print("Blastoff")
